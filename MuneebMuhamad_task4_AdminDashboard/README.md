## University management system

### Desciption:
I build univerity management for admin and students. <br>
The admin can read, create, update and delete students. <br>
The admin also assigns tasks to students which the student has to complete. <br>
Students can login and check the tasks to perform and can mark a task to be complete.

### How to run:
* Open two terminals
* In one terminal run "node server.js"
* In another terminal change into "admin-panel directory" and run "ng serve --open"
